# Longboard Speed-Sensing Ground Effect Lighting Project

LED Lighting for a Longboard, using a Hall effect sensor to detect wheel speed and an Arduino Pro Mini
to control the LEDs.

[See it in action](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmTzfEAPexU "Low budget demo").

[Some details](http://softsolder.com/2012/08/29/longboard-speed-sensing-ground-effect-lighting/ "Mostly the case")
with links to earlier posts.

The Longboard Case.scad file contains the 3D geometry for the printed plastic case.
It compiles under [OpenSCAD](http://www.openscad.org/) to produce the Build?.stl files.
Feed the STL files into a slicer such as Slic3r or Skeinforge to get the Build?.gcode files
that will actually produce the printed objects.

The image files may not represent the current state of the 3D model source code; they're just snapshots
along the way.
